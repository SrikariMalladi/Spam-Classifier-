# Spam-Classifier-
this project helps people to find out the spam mail easily so that they can avoid fake mail and will be able to keep the info safe 

# Spam filtering 
 A Python text classifier that uses machine learning classification algorithms (support vector machines, Naive Bayes classification) to identify whether a particular message or message is spam or spam (non-spam). Spam dataset is from Kaggle, UCI repository etc. 
 
 Email is an effective and very cheap communication tool that many organizations use to carry out their advertising. This process is  carried out so widely that millions of people's email boxes are full of spam. As a result, every user wastes a lot  of valuable time going through spam. In addition, server-to-server spam traffic delays the timely delivery of important messages to  users. Considering the scale and power of this problem, we developed a system that uses  Multinomial Naive Bayes theorem concepts and Support Vector Machines to detect spam. Our spam detection system detects emails as spam, saving millions of users time.
